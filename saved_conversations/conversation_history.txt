User: what is diabetes
ChatBot: Diabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose comes from the foods you eat. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. With diabetes, your body either doesn't make enough insulin or can't use its own insulin as well as it should. This causes too much glucose to build up in your blood.
